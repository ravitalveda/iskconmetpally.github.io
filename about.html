                                    Spread at about 4.5 acres, this “Farm Project” – Hare Krishna Mandiram is a humble offering to His Divine Grace Srila A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, Founder Acarya- International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), who paid great emphasis
                                    on the development of such self-sustaining farm communities where devotees could lead a simple God-centred life.

                      “..Our farm projects are an extremely important part of
                      our movement. We must become self-sufficient by growing
                      our own grains and producing our own milk, and then there
                      will be no question of poverty. So develop these farm
                      communities as far as possible. They should be developed
                      as an ideal society depending on natural products not
                      industry…”
